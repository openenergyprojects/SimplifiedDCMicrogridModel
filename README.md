# SimplifiedDCMicrogridModel
Simplified Model for a DC Microgrid that uses a DC/DC boost converter, a DC source and a simple resistor as load. 

This model could be used for comparison/matching between the block diagrams of a DC/Dc boost converter using Simscape models and their analytical equations. The model could be used to generate DC signals in lab and simulations that could be further analysed (e.g. for power quality, stability purposes, etc.).

The current model is presented in open loop (no closed loop controller is given). The controller is to be developed later.

The output of this Matlab Simulink project is used to generate the mat files for project: https://github.com/openenergyprojects/PQIndices_DCGrids
